# Introduction

[Donations List Website](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/) (DLW) is a website that tracks
the donations of individuals (mostly in the effective altruism and rationality communities),
private foundations, and other entities.
The website is created and maintained by [Vipul Naik](http://effective-altruism.com/user/vipulnaik/),
with contributions from me (Issa Rice).

The first half of this post gives a tutorial of DLW, focusing especially on
parts that are not obvious.
The second half of this post is a request for feedback.
Vipul and I are interested in using the feedback to help us decide where to
focus our efforts.

# Tutorial

This section is a tutorial of the main features of Donations List Website
(DLW), with a focus on the parts that are not obvious.

## Donor page

Each donor tracked by DLW has a donor page.
An example is the [donor page for the Open Philanthropy
Project](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project).

For Open Philanthropy Project in particular, there is a [table of disclosures](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project#donorDonationAmountsByDisclosuresAndYear) (from before it stopped announcing disclosures).

## Donee page

Each donee tracked by DLW has a donee page.
An example is the donee page for
[LessWrong 2.0](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donee.php?donee=LessWrong+2.0).

Some entities are both a donor and a donee, in which case there will be separate pages:

* https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Berkeley+Existential+Risk+Initiative
* https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donee.php?donee=Berkeley+Existential+Risk+Initiative

## Donor–donee page

It is sometimes interesting to look at a specific donor–donee pair and see all the donations made by the donor to the donee, their relationship, etc.
For this, DLW has a donor–donee page for each such pair.
An example of this is the page for
[Open Philanthropy Project donations made to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donorDonee.php?donor=Open+Philanthropy+Project&donee=Machine+Intelligence+Research+Institute).
